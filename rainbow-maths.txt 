# Rainbow Maths

This technique is helping children remember simple arithmetic with lots of repetition. The children will have to practice this daily and carry out simple addition. They can use a number line to help them add numbers. If the sum is 4 + 3, they could place a marker on 4 and then move it on 3 more. They then record the answer. They try to work through as many of these problems as they can in a time that you have set (e.g. 10 minutes).
