### Some teaching plans to teach maths to children with Special Educational Needs

This repository will have some basic documentation on how to teach simple concepts to children with special educational needs (SEN). 

When teaching maths, especially the concept of number, you should remember that children can learn simple concepts with smaller numbers and then you can increase the size of the number and see if the concept is still secure. 

For example, a child might learn how to add 10 to a number (10 + 3 = 13). Then, you will want to check that the child can add 10 to 23 (10 + 23 = 33). This will require the child to be secure in numbers up to 40. 

Children will need to learn to count to larger numbers all the way through these activities, by using a 100 square.
